Principle Name,Statement,Rationale,Implications,,
Address Privacy&Security,Address Privacy & Security,"Information is power, as the old adage goes, and this is certainly true in the context of technology-enabled global development interventions. How information is collected, stored, analysed, shared, and used has serious implications for both the populations about whom data are being transmitted, and the organizations transmitting the data. This principle: Address Privacy &amp; Security provides a framework for considering how to protect user privacy and the security of data, devices, and tools.","
	Assess and mitigate risks to the security of users and their data.
	Consider the context and needs for privacy of personally identifiable information when designing solutions and mitigate accordingly.
	Ensure equity and fairness in co-creation, and protect the best interests of the end end-users.
",,
Always consider the users,Always consider the users,"The security stance of a software system is inextricably linked to what its users do with it. It is therefore very important that all security-related mechanisms are designed in a manner that makes it easy to deploy, configure, use, and update the system securely. Remember, security is not a feature that can simply be added to a software  system, but rather a property emerging from how the system was built and is operated.

The way each user interacts with software is dictated not only by the design and implementation decisions of its creators but also by the cognitive abilities and cultural background of its users.","Failing to address this design principle can lead to a various problems, e.g.:

	When designers don’t “remember the user” in their software design, inadvertent disclosures by the user may take  place. If it is difficult to understand the authorization model, or difficult to understand the configuration for visibility  of data, then the user’s data are likely to be unintentionally disclosed.
	Designers sometimes fail to account for the fact that authenticated and properly authorized users can also be attackers! This design error is a failure to distrust the user, resulting in authorized users having opportunities to misuse the system.
	When security is too hard to set up for a large population of the system’s users, it will never be configured, or it will not be configured properly.

Asset protection and resilience,Asset protection and resilience,"Consumer data, and the assets storing or processing it, should be protected against physical tampering, loss, damage or seizure.","If this principle is not implemented, inappropriately protected consumer data could be compromised which may result in legal and regulatory sanction, or reputational damage.",,
Assume that external systems are insecure,Assume that external systems are insecure,"The term information domain arises from the practice of partitioning information resources according to access control, need, and levels of protection required. Organizations implement specific measures to enforce this partitioning and to provide for the deliberate flow of authorized information between information domains. The boundary of an information domain represents the security perimeter for that domain.

An external domain is one that is not under your control. In general, external systems should be considered insecure.",,,
Audit information provision to consumers,Audit information provision to consumers,"Consumers should be provided with the audit records they need to monitor access to their service and the data held within it. 
If this principle is not implemented, consumers will not be able to detect and respond to inappropriate or malicious use of their service or data within reasonable timescales.",,,
Authenticate users and processes to ensure appropriate access control decisions both within and across domains,Authenticate users and processes to ensure appropriate access control decisions both within and across domains,"Authentication is the process where a system establishes the validity of a transmission, message, or a means of verifying the eligibility of an individual, process, or machine to carry out a desired action, thereby ensuring that security is not compromised by an untrusted source. It is essential that adequate authentication be achieved in order to implement security policies and achieve security goals.",,,
Authorize after you authenticate,Authorize after you authenticate.,"Authorization should be conducted as an explicit check, and as necessary even after an initial authentication has been completed. Authorization depends not only on the privileges associated with an authenticated user, but also on the context of the request. The time of the request and the location of the requesting user may both need to be taken into account.","For particularly sensitive operations, authorization may need to invoke authentication.

Although authorization begins only after authentication has occurred, this requirement is not circular. Authentication is not binary—users may be required to present minimal (such as a password) or more substantial (e.g. biometric or token-based) evidence of their identity, and authentication in most systems is not continuous—a user may authenticate, but walk away from the device or hand it to someone else.",,
Avoid security by obscurity,Security measurements should be open and transparent.,"Assume attackers will have source code (also for closed source software).
Assume attackers will have complete design and network topologies.
Open security design promote cycle of improvement faster.",Security should always be tested by experts (open or not),,
"Check the return value of all non-void functions, and check the validity of all function parameters","Check the return value of all non-void functions, and check the validity of all function parameters.

The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each calling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside each function.","This is possibly the most frequently violated principle.In the strictest interpretation, this rule means that even the return value of printf statements and file close statements must be checked.
A case can be made, though, that if the response to an error would rightfully be no different than the response to success, there is no point in checking a return value. This is often the case with calls to printf and close. In cases like these, it can be acceptable to explicitly cast the function return value to (void) -- thereby indicating that the programmer explicitly and not accidentally decides to ignore a return value. The rule is then only violated if the cast is missing.
In more dubious cases, a comment should be present to explain why a return value is irrelevant.

In most cases, though, the return value of a function should not be ignored, especially if error return values must be propagated up the function call chain. Standard libraries famously violate this rule with potentially grave consequences. See, for instance, what happens if you accidentally execute

strlen(0)

, or

strcat(s1, s2, -1)

with the standard C string library. For this reason, most coding guidelines for safety critical software also forbid the use of all ansi standard headers like string.h, stdlib.h, stdio.h etc. If the function are needed, they should be written separately, and made compliant with safety critical use.

The enforcement of this principle make sure that exceptions are always explicitly justified (and justifiable), with mechanical checkers flagging violations.  Often, it will be easier to comply with the rule than to explain why non-compliance is acceptable.",Extra testing and programming effort:Function parameters should normal be verified for validity before being used. This rule especially applies to pointers: before dereferencing a pointer that is passed as a parameter the pointer must be checked for null.,,
Clearly delineate the physical and logical security boundaries governed by associated security policies.,Clearly delineate the physical and logical security boundaries governed by associated security policies.,"Information technology exists in physical and logical locations, and boundaries exist between these locations. An understanding of what is to be protected from external factors can help ensure adequate protective measures are applied where they will be most effective. Sometimes a boundary is defined by people, information, and information technology associated with one physical location.",,,
Compartmentalise,Sub-systems will be partitioned logically and isolated using physical devices and/or security controls,"In accordance with the Minimise Attack Surface and Defence in Depth principles, the Compartmentalise principle keeps a sub-system, or logically grouped set of sub-systems, relatively self-contained such that compromise of one will not imply the compromise of another.",,,
Compile with all warnings enabled,"Compile with all warnings enabled, in pedantic mode, and use one or more modern static source code analyzers.

All code must be compiled, from the first day of development, with all compiler warnings enabled at the compiler's most pedantic setting. All code must compile with these setting without warnings. All code must be checked on each build with at least one, but preferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer and should pass the analyses with zero warnings.","There are several very effective static source code analyzers on the market today, and quite a few freeware tools as well. There is no excuse for any serious software development effort not to make use of this technology. It should be considered routine practice, especially for critical software development. The rule of zero warnings applies even in cases where the compiler or the static analyzer gives an erroneous warning: if the compiler or the static analyzer gets confused, the code causing the confusion should be rewritten so that it becomes more trivially valid. Many have been caught in the assumption that a warning was likely invalid, only to realize much later that the report was in fact valid for less obvious reasons.
Static analyzers originally had a bad reputation due to the limited capabilities of early versions (e.g., the early Unix tool lint). The early tools produced mostly invalid messages, but this is not the case for the current generation of commercial tools. The best static analyzers today are fast, and they produce selective and accurate messages.","Provide awareness trainings of developers continuously.

Complete mediation,Complete mediation,"Access rights are completely validated every time an access occurs. Systems should rely as little as possible on access decisions retrieved from a cache. Again, file permissions tend to reflect this model: the operating system checks the user requesting access against the file’s ACL. The technique is less evident when applied to email, which must pass through separately applied packet filters, virus filters, and spam detectors.",,,
Computer Security is Constrained by Societal Factors,Computer Security is Constrained by Societal Factors,"The ability of security to support the mission of an organization may be limited by various factors, such as social issues. For example, security and workplace privacy can conflict.

Computer Security Requires a Comprehensive and Integrated Approach,Computer Security Requires a Comprehensive and Integrated Approach,"Providing effective computer security requires a comprehensive approach that considers a variety of areas both within and outside of the computer security field. This comprehensive approach extends throughout the entire information life cycle.
To work effectively, security controls often depend upon the proper functioning of other controls. Many such interdependencies exist. If appropriately chosen, managerial, operational,and technical controls can work together synergistically.","The effectiveness of security controls (also) depends on such factors as system management, legal issues, quality assurance, and internal and management controls. Computer security needs to work with traditional security disciplines including physical and personnel security.",,
Computer Security Responsibilities and Accountability Should Be Made Explicit,Computer Security Responsibilities and Accountability Should Be Made Explicit,"The responsibility and accountability3 of owners, providers, and users of IT systems and other parties4 concerned with the security of IT systems should be explicit.5 The assignment of responsibilities may be internal to an organization or may extend across organizational boundaries.","Depending on the size of the organization, the computer security program may be large or small, even a collateral duty of another management official. However, even small organizations can prepare a document that states organization policy and makes explicit computer security responsibilities.",,
Computer Security Should Be Cost-Effective,Computer Security Should Be Cost-Effective,"The costs and benefits of security should be carefully examined in both monetary and nonmonetary terms to ensure that the cost of controls does not exceed expected benefits.

Requirements for security vary, depending upon the particular IT system.",,,
Computer Security Should Be Periodically Reassessed,Computer Security Should Be Periodically Reassessed,"Computers and the environments in which they operate are dynamic. System technology and users, data and information in the systems, risks associated with the system, and security requirements are ever-changing. Many types of changes affect system security: technological developments (whether adopted by the system owner or available for use by others); connection to external networks; a change in the value or use of information; or the emergence of a new threat. In addition, security is never perfect when a system is implemented.",,,

In addition to the traditional aspects of data classification, this includes, but is not limited to, protection of per-decisional, sensitive, source selection-sensitive, and proprietary information.","Open sharing of information and the release of information via relevant legislation must be balanced against the need to restrict the availability of classified, proprietary, and sensitive information.

Existing laws and regulations require the safeguarding of security and the privacy of data, while permitting free and open access.","Aggregation of data, both classified and not, will create a large target requiring review and de-classification procedures to maintain appropriate control. 

Access to information based on a need-to-know policy will force regular reviews of the body of information.

Declare data objects at the smallest possible level of scope,Declare data objects at the smallest possible level of scope.,"Basic principle of data-hiding. Clearly if an object is not in scope, its value cannot be referenced or corrupted. Similarly, if an erroneous value of an object has to be diagnosed, the fewer the number of statements where the value could have been assigned; the easier it is to diagnose the problem. The rule discourages the re-use of variables for multiple, incompatible purposes, which can complicate fault diagnosis.","Data should always be declared at the start of the scope in which it is used: for file scope, the declarations go at the top of the source file (never in a header file); for function scope, the declaration goes at the top of the function body; for block scope, at the start of the block. This means that declarations should not be placed at random places in the code, e.g., that the point of first use.

The security policy begins with the organization’s basic commitment to information security formulated as a general policy statement. The policy is then applied to all aspects of the system design or security solution. The policy identifies security goals (e.g., confidentiality, integrity, availability, accountability, and assurance) the system should support, and these goals guide the procedures, standards and controls used in the IT security architecture design.

Windows access control list (ACL) settings may be inherited, and the “deny” right gives the user an easy way to revoke a right granted through inheritance.

Implement least privilege,Implement least privilege.,"The concept of limiting access, or least privilege"," is simply to provide no more authorizations than necessary to perform required functions. This is perhaps most often applied in the administration of the system. Its goal is to reduce risk by limiting the number of people with access to critical system security controls; i.e., controlling who is allowed to enable or disable system security features or change the privileges of users or programs.

Limit the use of pointers,"Limit the use of pointers. Use no more than N levels of dereferencing (star operators) per expression. A strict value for N=1, but in some cases using N=2 can be justified.

Pointer dereference operations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef declarations. The use of function pointers should be restricted to simple cases.","Pointers are easily misused, even by experienced programmers. They can make it hard to follow or analyze the flow of data in a program, especially by tool-based static analyzers. Function pointers, similarly, can seriously restrict the types of checks that can be performed by static analyzers and should only be used if there is a strong justification for their use, and ideally alternate means are provided to assist tool-based checkers determine flow of control and function call hierarchies. For instance, if function pointers are used, it can become impossible for a tool to prove absence of recursion, so alternate guarantees would have to be provided to make up for this loss in analytical capabilities.","It should be possible for a static analyzer to determine in all cases which function is being called, if the call is made through a function pointer. It may be acceptable to allow cases where the number of possible functions that may be called is larger than one, provided it does not affect the precision of the code analysis itself. This means that it can depend on the capabilities of a specific static analyzer what liberties can be taken with the use of function pointers.
Additionally, though, it is wise to keep function pointer use to a minimum, and to restrict to simple cases, to make sure that also humans can determine accurately and with modest effort which functions may be evoked.",,
Limit the use of the preprocessor to file inclusion and simple macros,"Limit the use of the preprocessor to file inclusion and simple macros.

The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of header files and simple macro definitions. Token pasting, variable argument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not permitted.
All macros must expand into complete syntactic units.
The use of conditional compilation directives should be restricted to the prevention of duplicate file inclusion in header files.","The C preprocessor is a powerful obfuscation tool that can destroy code clarity and befuddle many text based checkers. The effect of constructs in unrestricted preprocessor code can be extremely hard to decipher, even with a formal language definition in hand. In a new implementation of the C preprocessor, developers often have to resort to using earlier implementations as the referee for interpreting complex defining language in the C standard. The rationale for the caution against conditional compilation is equally important. Note that with just ten conditional compilation directives, there could be up to 2^10 (i.e., 1024) possible versions of the code, each of which would have to be tested -- causing a significant increase in the required test effort.","Macros should only appear in header files, never in the source code itself. The #undef directive should not be used. Macros should never hide declarations, and they should not hide pointer dereference operations from the code. Macros should also never be used to redefine the language.

The restriction of macro definitions to the definition of complete syntactic units means that all macro bodies must be enclosed in either round or curly braces.

Risks must identified so we are aware of what risks can occur, what existing controls are in place, the consequence and likelihood of the risk occurring, and a determination is made about how to treat those risks.

	Options for addressing information risk should be reviewed so that informed
and documented decisions are made about the treatment of risk. Risk
treatment involves choosing one or more options, which typically include:
Accepting risk (by an appropriate team member signing off that he/she
has accepted the risk and no further action is required)
	Avoiding risk (by an appropriate team member deciding not to pursue a
particular initiative)
	Transferring risk (by an appropriate team member to an external entity
such as insurance)
	Mitigating risk (by an appropriate team member by applying appropriate
information security measures, e.g., access controls, network
monitoring and incident management)

Security by Design,"Controls for the protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability should be designed into all aspects of solutions from initiation, not as an afterthought. Security should also be designed into the business processes within which an IT system will be used.","The implementation of protections for confidentiality, availability and integrity within information and systems at the end of a project is more expensive than including the security protections within the initial design of the project. Controls implemented at the end of a project are often less efficient and less integrated than those integrated within the core of the project.

&nbsp;","
	Security is designed in as an integrated part of the system architecture, not added as an afterthought.
	Security mechanisms must span all tiers of the architecture, and must be scalable.
	All solutions, custom or commercial, must be tested for security.
	Possible areas of control which could be addressed and integrated include (but are not limited to): asset management and information classification;
physical security; segregation of duties, protections against malicious code; backup; exchange of information; logging and monitoring; user access management; technical vulnerability management; compliance with legal requirements; and, information systems audit considerations.

Sensitive data must be identified,Sensitive data must be identified and it should be defined how the data is handled.,"Data sets do not exist only at rest, but in transit between components within a single system and between organizations. As data sets transit between systems, they may cross multiple trust boundaries. Identifying these boundaries and rectifying them with data protection policies is an essential design activity. Trust is just as tricky as data sensitivity, and the notion of trust enclaves is likely to dominate security conversations in the next decade.","Policy requirements and data sensitivity can change over time as the business climate evolves, as regulatory regimes change, as systems become increasingly interconnected, and as new data sources are incorporated into a system. Regularly revisiting and revising data protection policies and their design implications is essential.",,

	It’s preferable to have a single method, component, or system responsible for authenticating users. Such a single mechanism can serve as a logical “choke point” that cannot be bypassed.
	Much as in code reuse, once a single mechanism has been determined to be correct, it makes sense to leverage it for all authentication.
